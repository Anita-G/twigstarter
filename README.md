##Â TwigStarter

TwigStarter is a small app for Twig integrators.

It allows them to easily create templates, using the power of Twig.

### Requirements

- PHP >= 5.4
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Installation

- Clone the repo : ` git clone git@github.com:blaiskillian/twigstarter`
- Install dependancies : `composer install`
- Copy the .env-example file to .env, and edit the `BASE_URL` with your own if necessary

### Usage

#### Routing

Let's say you need to create a route for the URL `/foo/bar`.

The only thing you need to do is to create the file `app/foo/bar.php`, that's it ! (you can also create a `app/foo/bar/index.php`)

#### Templating

Put your Twig templates in `resources/views`.

Templates can be called with a dot notation.

Let's imagine you need to extend the `foo/bar.twig` file, use `{% extends 'foo.bar' %}`.

#### Faker

You can generate fake data using the `$faker` variable.

It uses [F. Zaninotto's Faker lib](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker). The formatter's list is available [here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#formatters).

#### Request/Response

This app uses [sabre/http](sabre.io/http/) library, that provides `Request` and `Response` objects to interact with HTTP requests and reponses.

It provides a `$request` and a `$response` variables in app files, that allow you to access HTTP request data and to create a custom request (HTTP code, headers, etc...).
